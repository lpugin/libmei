/** \brief Identifies a recognized group of pitches that are known as belonging to a single

 * 
 *  This is used instead of the earlier "ineume" and "uneume" grouping. Neumes may
 *  be nested, so it is possible to, for example, construct a neume from a number of
 *  sub-neume components. This is useful in situations where there is no pre-
 *  determined name for a given figure, i.e., compound neumes. As well, neume allows
 *  ligature elements as children. Ligatures may be either "recta" or "obliqua." In
 *  practice most neumes are "recta" so it may be safe to omit any ligature element.
 *  However, in compound neume cases it can be useful to precisely spell out the
 *  forms that are given.
